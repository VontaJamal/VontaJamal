# Execute ⚔️

I architect systems where AI agents coordinate, report to each other, and execute 24/7 without human intervention.

---

## 🏴‍☠️ Sovereign

An ecosystem of open-source tools, training programs, and autonomous systems — all interconnected, all in production, all free to use.

Everything here solves a real problem I hit while building. Nothing is portfolio filler. Clone it, use it, make it yours.

---

### The Ecosystem

**⚔️ [The Armory](https://github.com/VontaJamal/armory)** — Developer tools themed after Final Fantasy  
Key vaults, system diagnostics, security scans, backups, monitoring. Equip your terminal. Works standalone — no dependencies on anything else here.

**⚔️ [Shadow Gate](https://github.com/VontaJamal/shadow-gate)** — Gamified developer accountability  
Your git history becomes your quest log. XP, ranks, streaks, punishments for not shipping. Inspired by Solo Leveling's ranking system. The code knows when you stop.

**🛡️ [Seven Shadow System](https://github.com/VontaJamal/seven-shadow-system)** — AI review guard for pull requests  
Detect AI-generated reviews, enforce disclosure, require human sign-off. Drop it into any repo as a submodule. Policy-driven and auditable.

**🎙️ [Faye](https://github.com/VontaJamal/faye)** — Give your AI a voice  
Wake word detection + ElevenLabs TTS. Say a word, your AI talks back through your speaker. One setup. Open source. Named after Glenda Faye McPhail.

**🥋 [Dojo](https://github.com/VontaJamal/dojo)** — Multi-agent orchestration training `🌀 Materializing...`  
12 weeks. White belt to black belt. Walk in not knowing how to coordinate agents. Walk out building systems that run autonomously.

**📖 [Grimoire](https://github.com/VontaJamal/grimoire)** — Flashcards built on learning science `🌀 Materializing...`  
Spaced repetition, retrieval practice, interleaving — from *Make It Stick*. Not another Anki clone.

**📓 [Bingo Book](https://github.com/VontaJamal/bingo-book)** — Rank every anime you've watched `🌀 Materializing...`  
Mt. Rushmore your top 4. Grade everything F through S. Share your profile. If you don't know what a Bingo Book is, this ain't for you.

**<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VontaJamal/VontaJamal/main/assets/synclink-icon.png" alt="SyncLink" width="20"/> [SyncLink](https://getsynclink.app)** — Cross-platform media sync  
Chrome extension + cloud. Save on one platform, access everywhere. Pre-launch.

### The Seven Shadows

The engineering principles that govern every line of code shipped under Sovereign.

| Shadow | Domain |
|--------|--------|
| ✨ **Aesthetics** | Visual identity, UX clarity, motion language. Animation is first-class when it serves delight or comprehension. Every product keeps its own character. |
| 🔒 **Security** | Threat modeling, trust boundaries, secrets protection, hardening. AI outputs are untrusted input. No raw credentials touch external systems. |
| ♿ **Access** | WCAG 2.2 AA, keyboard-first, semantic HTML, screen-reader behavior. Delight never blocks usability. |
| 🧪 **Testing** | Behavior-first. E2E and integration over unit test theater. Tests prove the system works for users. |
| ⚡ **Execution** | Feature-branch delivery, clean-tree gates, run-to-completion. Never claim done while the branch is dirty. |
| ⚖️ **Scales** | Right-size complexity. Minimal viable architecture first. Simple when simple is enough, aggressive when it's not. |
| 💎 **Value** | Every feature drives adoption, retention, or revenue. Pretty without purpose doesn't ship. |

### The Stack

TypeScript · React · Node.js · Python · PostgreSQL · Google Cloud · Solana/Web3

10+ years shipping. Anything I don't know, I learn when I need it. That's always been the cheat code.

---

### Beyond Code

- 🍜 **Anime** is culture, not a hobby. Naruto is the #1 anime of all time. The Uchiha were done wrong. I have the tattoos to prove it.
- 🏋🏾 **Fitness** — Same discipline that ships code moves weight.
- 📍 Raleigh, NC
