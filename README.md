# ΓÜö∩╕Å Indra Uchiha

**Software engineer building autonomous systems that don't need me to run.**

I don't just use AI tools ΓÇö I architect systems where AI agents coordinate, report to each other, and execute 24/7 without human intervention.

### What I'm Building

**≡ƒûñ The Shadow Dominion** ΓÇö A multi-agent AI ecosystem  
Multiple AI agents running 24/7 on dedicated infrastructure, each owning a domain. A central orchestrator coordinates everything ΓÇö dispatching tasks, synthesizing results, making decisions. Agent-to-agent communication, file-based memory systems, automated Telegram reporting. Not a demo. Not a proof of concept. Production infrastructure I rely on daily.

**ΓÜö∩╕Å [The Monarch System](https://github.com/VontaJamal/the-monarch-system)** ΓÇö Gamified accountability, open source  
Every morning a system scans my git history and generates daily quests based on real work. XP, ranks, streaks, punishments for failure. Inspired by Solo Leveling's ranking system. If I don't ship, the system knows. Can't negotiate with code.

**≡ƒöù SyncLink** ΓÇö Cross-platform media sync  
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VontaJamal/VontaJamal/main/assets/synclink-icon.png" alt="SyncLink" width="20" align="center"/> Chrome extension + cloud infrastructure for syncing saved content across platforms. Save on one platform, access everywhere. Currently in pre-launch.

**≡ƒôè Autonomous Trading Infrastructure**  
Real-time data pipelines, automated signal scoring, paper trading execution, and self-tuning strategy parameters. Built on supply & demand + Fibonacci confluence with health gates that refuse to execute when conditions are wrong.

### How I Think

- **Systems over features.** I don't build things ΓÇö I build systems that build things.
- **Automation is silence.** The goal isn't a dashboard full of green lights. It's hearing nothing because everything works.
- **Observability > testing.** Tests prove defects exist, not that they don't. I'd rather see every decision my system made and WHY than have 100 unit tests that pass.
- **Self-healing > monitoring.** If your system can detect the problem, it should fix the problem. Alerts are a failure state.

### The Stack

TypeScript ┬╖ React ┬╖ Node.js ┬╖ Python ┬╖ PostgreSQL ┬╖ Google Cloud ┬╖ Tailscale ┬╖ Solana/Web3

Not listed because they matter less than what I build with them.

### Beyond Code

- ≡ƒì£ **Anime** is culture, not a hobby. Naruto is the #1 anime of all time. The Uchiha were done wrong. Yu-Gi-Oh is S tier and I will hear nothing about it. I have the tattoos to prove my commitment.
- ≡ƒÄ┤ **MTG player** ΓÇö strategy games sharpen how I think about systems
- ≡ƒÅï≡ƒÅ╛ **Fitness** ΓÇö Wendler 5/3/1, consistency over intensity
- ≡ƒôì Raleigh, NC

### Let's Talk

If you're building autonomous systems, multi-agent architectures, or just think differently about software ΓÇö I'm interested.
