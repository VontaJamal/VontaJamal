# Execute ⚔️ — I don't build software. My Shadows build systems 🖤

I architect systems where AI agents coordinate, report to each other, and execute 24/7 without human intervention.

---

### What I'm Building

**🖤 The Shadow Dominion** — A multi-agent AI ecosystem  
Multiple AI agents running 24/7 on dedicated infrastructure, each owning a domain. A central orchestrator coordinates everything — dispatching tasks, synthesizing results, making decisions. Agent-to-agent communication, file-based memory systems, automated Telegram reporting. Not a demo. Not a proof of concept. Production infrastructure I rely on daily.

**⚔️ [Shadow Gate](https://github.com/VontaJamal/shadow-gate)** — Gamified developer accountability, open source  
Your git history becomes your quest log. XP, ranks, streaks, punishments for failure. Inspired by Solo Leveling's ranking system. If I don't ship, the system knows. Can't negotiate with code.

**🛡️ [Seven Shadow System](https://github.com/VontaJamal/seven-shadow-system)** — AI review guard for pull requests  
Detect AI-generated reviews, enforce disclosure tags, require human approvals. Drop it into any repo as a submodule. Policy-driven, deterministic, auditable.

**🎙️ [Faye](https://github.com/VontaJamal/faye)** — Have your own OpenClaw bot arise and speak to you. One click. Open source.  
Wake word detection + ElevenLabs TTS. Say a word into the air, your AI talks back through your speaker. Named after Glenda Faye McPhail.

**🃏 [Shadow Dominion](https://github.com/VontaJamal/shadow-dominion)** — Flashcard system with spaced repetition and Make It Stick principles  
Organize cards by chapter, filter what you study, review on your terms. Anki-style scheduling meets retrieval practice, interleaving, and elaboration. Learn anything. Remember everything.

**<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VontaJamal/VontaJamal/main/assets/synclink-icon.png" alt="SyncLink" width="28"/> SyncLink** — Cross-platform media sync  
Chrome extension + cloud infrastructure for syncing saved content across platforms. Save on one platform, access everywhere. Currently in pre-launch.

**📊 Autonomous Trading Infrastructure**  
Real-time data pipelines, automated signal scoring, paper trading execution, and self-tuning strategy parameters. Built on supply & demand + Fibonacci confluence with health gates that refuse to execute when conditions are wrong.

### The Seven Shadows

The royal elite guard of my engineering. Seven domains that govern every line of code that ships under the Shadow Dominion.

| Shadow | Domain |
|--------|--------|
| ✨ **Aesthetics** | Visual identity, UX clarity, motion language, and cross-repo interface quality. Animation and whimsical flourishes are first-class — but only when they serve delight, comprehension, or retention. Every product keeps its own character. |
| 🔒 **Security** | Threat modeling, trust boundaries, input safety, secrets protection, hardening, and release gates. AI outputs are untrusted input. No raw credentials touch external systems. Ever. |
| ♿ **Accessibility** | WCAG 2.2 AA compliance, keyboard-first navigation, semantic HTML, screen-reader behavior, non-color-only communication, and reduced-motion paths. Delight never blocks usability. |
| 🧪 **Testing** | Behavior-first doctrine — E2E and integration over unit test theater. Tests prove the system works for users, not that functions return values. AI can draft tests; humans review for brittleness and false confidence. |
| ⚡ **Execution** | Feature-branch-first delivery, autonomous run-to-completion, blocker-only interruptions, clean-tree gates. Never claim done while the branch is dirty. Accountability stays human-owned. |
| ⚖️ **Scales** | Right-size complexity. Minimal viable architecture first — scale only when measured constraints demand it. Never overbuild by default. Simple when simple is enough, aggressive when it's not. |
| 💎 **Value** | Every feature must drive adoption, retention, or revenue — not just look good. AI-enabled features require measurable success signals and fallback behavior. Pretty without purpose doesn't ship. |

### The Stack

TypeScript · React · Node.js · Python · PostgreSQL · Google Cloud · Solana/Web3

10+ years shipping with these. I was already dangerous. The Shadows just took the ceiling off.

Anything I don't know, I learn when I need it. That's always been the cheat code.

### Beyond Code

- 🍜 **Anime** is culture, not a hobby. Naruto is the #1 anime of all time. The Uchiha were done wrong. Yu-Gi-Oh is S tier and I will hear nothing about it. I have the tattoos to prove my commitment.
- 🎴 **MTG player** — strategy games sharpen how I think about systems
- 🏋🏾 **Fitness** — Same discipline that ships code moves weight. No days off.
- 📍 Raleigh, NC

### Let's Talk

If you're building autonomous systems, multi-agent architectures, or just think differently about software — I'm interested.
